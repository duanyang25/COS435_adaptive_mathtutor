    "# Extract the following features from this tutoring interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. MISCONCEPTION TYPE - This classification MUST be determined SOLELY from the student profile, not from the conversation. It represents the student's core misunderstanding and should be CONSISTENT across all interactions with this same student. Choose ONE of these types based only on the student profile description:\n",
    "# - operation_error: Student applies the wrong operation (e.g., adding instead of multiplying)\n",
    "# - number_fact_error: Student makes errors in basic number facts (e.g., multiplication tables)\n",
    "# - variable_meaning_error: Student misunderstands what variables represent\n",
    "# - conceptual_error: Student has fundamental misconception about a math concept\n",
    "# - calculation_error: Student makes arithmetic errors during calculation\n",
    "# - problem_interpretation_error: Student misunderstands what the problem is asking\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. LISTEN TO FEEDBACK:\n",
    "#    - 1 if the student has incorporated the teacher's feedback in the current conversation state\n",
    "#    - 0 if not\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. PROBLEM PROGRESS - Numerical estimate (0-100) of how close, given the student's current conversation state, the student is to the correct solution. For example:\n",
    "#   - 0: No progress/completely wrong approach\n",
    "#   - 25: Beginning to understand but major errors remain\n",
    "#   - 50: Halfway to solution with some key insights\n",
    "#   - 75: Minor errors but mostly correct approach\n",
    "#   - 100: Complete and correct solution\n",
    "#   (You may use any value between 0-100, not just the examples above)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. PROBLEM CONCEPT:\n",
    "#    The specific math domain/concept being tested. Based on the question, choose the one most relevant concept: \"basic_arithmetic\", \"fractions_decimals_and_percents\", \"ratios_proportions_and_rates\", \"measurement_and_geometry\", \"counting_and_combinatorics\", \"money_and_finance\", or \"algebraic_relationships\".\n",

    "#    - 1 if correct\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. PROBLEM DIFFICULTY (1-3):\n",
    "#    Rate how difficult the math question is on a scale from 1 to 5, where:\n",
    "#    - 1 = Very easy, basic concepts, straightforward approach\n",
    "#    - 2 = Moderate, requires some thought, multiple steps\n",

      "- operation_error: Student applies the wrong operation (e.g., adding instead of multiplying)\n",

    "Extract the following features from this tutoring interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MISCONCEPTION TYPE - This classification MUST be determined SOLELY from the student profile, not from the conversation. It represents the student's core misunderstanding and should be CONSISTENT across all interactions with this same student. Choose ONE of these types based only on the student profile description:\n",
    "- operation_error: Student applies the wrong operation (e.g., adding instead of multiplying)\n",
    "- number_fact_error: Student makes errors in basic number facts (e.g., multiplication tables)\n",
    "- variable_meaning_error: Student misunderstands what variables represent\n",
    "- conceptual_error: Student has fundamental misconception about a math concept\n",
    "- calculation_error: Student makes arithmetic errors during calculation\n",
    "- problem_interpretation_error: Student misunderstands what the problem is asking\n",

    "2. LISTEN TO FEEDBACK:\n",
    "   - 1 if the student has incorporated the teacher's feedback in the current conversation state\n",
    "   - 0 if not\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PROBLEM PROGRESS - Numerical estimate (0-100) of how close, given the student's current conversation state, the student is to the correct solution. For example:\n",
    "  - 0: No progress/completely wrong approach\n",
    "  - 25: Beginning to understand but major errors remain\n",
    "  - 50: Halfway to solution with some key insights\n",
    "  - 75: Minor errors but mostly correct approach\n",
    "  - 100: Complete and correct solution\n",
    "  (You may use any value between 0-100, not just the examples above)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PROBLEM CONCEPT:\n",
    "   The specific math domain/concept being tested. Based on the question, choose the one most relevant concept: \"basic_arithmetic\", \"fractions_decimals_and_percents\", \"ratios_proportions_and_rates\", \"measurement_and_geometry\", \"counting_and_combinatorics\", \"money_and_finance\", or \"algebraic_relationships\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. CONVERSATION TURN:\n",
    "   The number of exchanges so far.\n",
