I started by subtracting the 5 pieces of chocolates that were not in a box from the total of 50 chocolates. That gave me 45 chocolates in the boxes. Then I added the 25 chocolates that Nida's friend brought, giving me a total of 70 chocolates. Since each box can hold 6 chocolates, I divided 70 by 6 to get 11.67 boxes. Since you can't have a fraction of a box, I rounded up to 12 boxes. Since they already had 3 boxes, I subtracted 3 from 12 to get 9 more boxes.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)Can you please justify your assumption of 6 chocolates in box?|EOM|Student: Yes, I assumed that each box could hold 6 chocolates because it wasn't specified in the problem. I thought that 6 chocolates per box would be a reasonable assumption since it would make the math easier and it would be a reasonable amount of chocolates to fit in a box.|EOM|Teacher: (probing)That is not a justified reason. You don't solve math this way. Let us do something else. If 40 pencils are to be arranged in 4 boxes, how would you do it?|EOM|Student: I would divide 40 by 4 to get 10. That means each box would contain 10 pencils. Then I would take 10 pencils and put them in the first box, then 10 more in the second box, and so on until all 4 boxes contain 10 pencils each.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)Good. Keeping this in  mind can you arrange 45 chocolates for Nida?|EOM|Student: Yes, I can arrange 45 chocolates for Nida. I would divide 45 by 6 to get 7.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a box, I would round up to 8 boxes. Then I would take 8 chocolates and put them in the first box, then 8 more in the second box, and so on until all 8 boxes contain 8 chocolates each.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)Remember that only 3 boxes were available for 45 chocolates and 5 were left back. |EOM|Student: Oh, I see. So, I would take the 3 boxes available and put 8 chocolates in each box, giving me 24 chocolates. Then, I would take the remaining 21 chocolates and put them in 5 boxes, giving me 5 boxes with 4 chocolates each.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)That doesn't make sense. Can you arrange 45 chocolates in 3 boxes?|EOM|Student: Yes, I can arrange 45 chocolates in 3 boxes. I would divide 45 by 3 to get 15. That means each box would contain 15 chocolates. Then I would take 15 chocolates and put them in the first box, then 15 more in the second box, and 15 more in the third box. That would give me 3 boxes with 15 chocolates each.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)Yes exactly. Now Nida gets 25 more chocolates and 5 were left previously. Can you fill them in boxes similarly and calculate the number of boxes required?|EOM|Student: Yes, I can fill them in boxes. I would take the 25 chocolates and add them to the 3 boxes, giving me 18 chocolates in the first box, 18 in the second box, and 19 in the third box. Then I would take the 5 remaining chocolates and put them in a fourth box. That would give me 4 boxes with 18, 18, 19, and 5 chocolates respectively.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)25+5=30 chocolates to be put in boxes. each can hold 15. so for 30, 2 boxes are required as 30/15=2 more boxes. Do you get it?|EOM|Student: Yes, I understand now. To put 30 chocolates in boxes, we need 2 boxes since 30/15 = 2. So, we need 4 boxes in total to put all 50 chocolates in boxes.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)No. We need 5 boxes for 75 chocolates.|EOM|Student: Oh, I see. So, we need 5 boxes for 75 chocolates. We already have 3 boxes, so we need 5 - 3 = 2 more boxes. Therefore, we need 2 more boxes to put all 75 chocolates in boxes.\",\n          \"Teacher: (generic)guide me through your working sout here please|EOM|Teacher: (generic)guide me through your workings please|EOM|Teacher: (generic)show me what you did|EOM|Teacher: (generic)what did you do here?|EOM|Teacher: (generic)hi scott|EOM|Teacher: (generic)how you worked this out?|EOM|Student: Hi teacher! I started by calculating the total number of eggs laid by all the doves, which is 20 x 3 = 60 eggs. Then I calculated the number of eggs that hatched, which is 3/4 x 60 = 45. Since each dove laid 3 eggs, the number of new doves is 45/3 = 15. Finally, the total number of doves Giselle has now is 20 + 15 = 35.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)i can see your first couple of steps are correct so yes it is 60 eggs in total. Then 45 hatched. you need to add that amount to the amount of doves she initially had=?|EOM|Student: That's right! So the total number of doves Giselle has now is 20 + 15 = 35.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)no 45 hatched so that is added to the initial 20 yes?|EOM|Student: Yes, that's correct. So the total number of doves Giselle has now is 20 + 45 = 65.|EOM|Teacher: (generic)can you see where you went wrong?|EOM|Student: Yes, I initially added the number of new doves (15) instead of the number of hatched eggs (45).|EOM|Teacher: (generic)good you should alwasy check your work to ensure everything is correctly worked out or to identify any errors|EOM|Student: Yes, I understand. Thank you for your help!\",\n          \"Teacher: (telling)Firstly you need to remember that the total amount of goals scored was 300. You need to find the equal amount of goals scored between ALL players|EOM|Student: Oh, I see. So the total number of goals scored by the two players is 300, and each player scored 300/2 = 150 goals.|EOM|Teacher: (probing)Remember 20% of all goals scored were by these two|EOM|Student: That's right! So the total number of goals scored in the league is 100/20% x 300 = 1500 goals, and the total number of goals scored by the two players is 20% of 1500 = 300 goals. Each player scored 300/2 = 150 goals.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)try swapping 100/20 to 20/100|EOM|Student: Ah, that's right. The total number of goals scored in the league is 20/100 x 300 = 600 goals, and the total number of goals scored by the two players is 20% of 600 = 120 goals. Each player scored 120/2 = 60 goals.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)Not times but divide|EOM|Student: Ah, that's right. The total number of goals scored in the league is 20/100 x 300 = 600 goals, and the total number of goals scored by the two players is 20% of 600 = 120 goals. Each player scored 120/2 = 60 goals.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)remember the total number of goals in 300 not 600|EOM|Student: Oh, I see. So the total number of goals scored by the two players is 300, and each player scored 300/2 = 150 goals.|EOM|Teacher: (probing)What is 20% of 300|EOM|Student: 20% of 300 is 60.|EOM|Teacher: (probing)So if the two players divide those goals between them they get?|EOM|Student: The two players would each get 60 goals.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)No. divide by 2|EOM|Student: Ah, that's right.

    "TASK:\n",
    "Extract the following features from this tutoring interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MISCONCEPTION TYPE - This classification MUST be determined SOLELY from the student profile, not from the conversation. It represents the student's core misunderstanding and should be CONSISTENT across all interactions with this same student. Choose ONE of these types based only on the student profile description:\n",
    "- operation_error: Student applies the wrong operation (e.g., adding instead of multiplying)\n",
    "- number_fact_error: Student makes errors in basic number facts (e.g., multiplication tables)\n",
    "- variable_meaning_error: Student misunderstands what variables represent\n",
    "- conceptual_error: Student has fundamental misconception about a math concept\n",
    "- calculation_error: Student makes arithmetic errors during calculation\n",
    "- problem_interpretation_error: Student misunderstands what the problem is asking\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LISTEN TO FEEDBACK:\n",
    "   - 1 if the student has incorporated the teacher's feedback in the current conversation state\n",
    "   - 0 if not\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PROBLEM PROGRESS - Numerical estimate (0-100) of how close, given the student's current conversation state, the student is to the correct solution. For example:\n",
    "  - 0: No progress/completely wrong approach\n",
    "  - 25: Beginning to understand but major errors remain\n",
    "  - 50: Halfway to solution with some key insights\n",
    "  - 75: Minor errors but mostly correct approach\n",
    "  - 100: Complete and correct solution\n",
    "  (You may use any value between 0-100, not just the examples above)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PROBLEM CONCEPT:\n",
    "   The specific math domain/concept being tested. Based on the question, choose the one most relevant concept: \"basic_arithmetic\", \"fractions_decimals_and_percents\", \"ratios_proportions_and_rates\", \"measurement_and_geometry\", \"counting_and_combinatorics\", \"money_and_finance\", or \"algebraic_relationships\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. CONVERSATION TURN:\n",
    "   The number of exchanges so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. CORRECT SOLUTION:\n",
    "   - 0 if the student's final answer is incorrect\n",
    "   - 1 if correct\n",
    "\n",
    "7. PROBLEM DIFFICULTY (1-3):\n",

    "   - 1 = Very easy, basic concepts, straightforward approach\n",
    "   - 2 = Moderate, requires some thought, multiple steps\n",
    "   - 3 = Challenging, complex approach, requires deeper understanding\n",

    "   How strong is the teacher's hint? (0=very minimal hint, 4=essentially giving away the entire solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. NEXT ACTION CATEGORY:\n",
